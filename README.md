This is a fork of Berkeley AUTOLAB's Dex-Net Package by Silvia Sapora.
Original repo: [Dexterity Network (Dex-Net)](https://berkeleyautomation.github.io/dex-net)
Original work by: Mahler, Jeffrey, Jacky Liang, Sherdil Niyaz, Michael Laskey, Richard Doan, Xinyu Liu, Juan Aparicio Ojea, and Ken Goldberg. "Dex-Net 2.0: Deep Learning to Plan Robust Grasps with Synthetic Point Clouds and Analytic Grasp Metrics." Robotics: Science and Systems (2017). Boston, MA.

The file install_history.txt contains a list of commands I ran on a fresh install of Ubuntu 18.04 to make Dex-Net work.
There are also a series of changes I made to the source code to make it work.
